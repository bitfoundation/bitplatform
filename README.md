# Introduction

Bit platform is the home for .NET developers. 
Bit provides dotnet source templates such as TodoTemplate and AdminPanel template. In these project templates, common features such as Sign-up & Sign-in, are available using C#, HTML, and CSS, with which most of the .NET developers are familiar.

The following apps are available out of the box with simple configurations:
* Android app with full access to platform features
* iOS app with full access to platform features
* Windows app with full access to platform features
* PWA (for offline-capable web apps)
* SPA with/without Pre-Rendering (SEO friendly)

Using these templates, one can easily switch between Blazor Server, Blazor Web Assembly, and Blazor Hybrid:
* Blazor Server: best for fast development and debugging
* Blazor Web Assembly: best for SPA & PWA (for production)
* Blazor Hybrid: provides apps for Android, iOS, and Windows

In practice, everyone can have the above outputs with just one codebase.


These templates are powered by Bit Blazor components. Bit components are fast(performant) and lightweight (less than 200KB). These components are the best tool to develop most apps, even public websites like e-commerce.


The following websites are developed by Bit Platform and published in Blazor Web Assembly:

* [Bit Components web site](https://components.bitplatform.dev/)
* [Bit Components mobile app](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/bitfoundation/apps/bitcomponents/distribution_groups/testers)

* [Bit Platform web site](https://bitplatform.dev/)

* [Todo SSR enabled web app](https://todo.bitplatform.dev/)
* [Todo PWA](https://todo-app.bitplatform.dev/)
* [Todo mobile app](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/bitfoundation/apps/todo/distribution_groups/testers)

* [Admin panel multilingual web app](https://adminpanel.bitplatform.dev/)
* [Admin panel multilingual mobile app](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/bitfoundation/apps/adminpanel/distribution_groups/testers)

Keep in mind that if a web app is only fast in the Blazor Server mode but slow in Blazor Web Assembly mode, it will also be slow in Blazor Hybrid mode (Android, iOS, and Windows apps).
