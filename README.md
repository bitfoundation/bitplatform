# Introduction

Bit platform is a home for .NET developers. 
Bit provides dotnet source templates such as TodoTemplate and AdminPanel template. In these project templates, common features such as Sign-up & Sign-in, are available using C#, HTML, and CSS, with which most of the .NET developers are familiar.

The following apps are available out of the box with simple configurations:
* Android app with full access to platform features
* iOS app with full access to platform features
* Windows app with full access to platform features
* PWA (You can develop offline-capable web apps)
* SPA with/without Pre-Rendering (SEO friendly)

Using these templates, one can easily switch between Blazor Server, Blazor Web Assembly, and Blazor Hybrid:
* Blazor Server: best for fast development and debugging
* Blazor Web Assembly: best for SPA & PWA for customers
* Blazor Hybrid: provides apps for Android, iOS, and Windows

In practice, everyone can have the above outputs with just one codebase.


In template ha, powered hastan by bit components. Bit components ham sari va ham kam hajm (less than 200KB!) hastan. in component ha tanha va behtarin abzari hastan ke ba oonha mitoonid hata web site haye public mesl e ecommerece tosee bedid.


Site haye zir, tamaman ba bit platform toseye peyda kardan va tamaman dar mode e blazor web assembly publish shodan. Dar nazar dashte bashid agar site e shoma faghat dar halat e blazor server sari bashad (ke be tosiyeye ma faghat monaseb debugging hast, na publish baraye moshtari) va dar mode e web assembly kond bashad, Android, iOS, Windows app e haman barname dar halat e blazor hybrid ham kond khahand bood.
