        In <span class="bold-txt">PWA</span>, a manifest is generated and all files will be downloaded by PWA with the help of this manifest. In this case, the PWA app can work in offline mode, and for example, we can leverage ef-core and SqlLite in the browser, which will work offline, and after going online, it can synchronize the generated data with the server if necessary.
        <br />If a file is changed (such as font, photo, etc.), the latest changes will be automatically downloaded.
        <br /><span class="bold-txt">Note</span>: that if you do not need a file, be sure to delete it so that it is no longer downloaded by PWA.
        <br />In <span class="bold-txt">SPA</span> if the .js, .css, and .dll files are changed, the new version will be automatically downloaded (by the asp-append-version in _Layout. cshtml). But for other file types such as font, image, etc, the file name must also be changed to ensure that the client is updated.
