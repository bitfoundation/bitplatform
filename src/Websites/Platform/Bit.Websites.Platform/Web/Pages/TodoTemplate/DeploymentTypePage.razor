            <a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-server-side-rendering" rel="nofollow">Server-side rendering (SSR)</a>, is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; Blazor pre-renders page and sends it as a static page, then later the page becomes an interactive Blazor app. This behavior is intended to serve pages quickly to search engines with time-based positioning.
            Statically prerender the component along with a marker to indicate the component should later be rendered interactively by the Blazor app. It improve SEO.
