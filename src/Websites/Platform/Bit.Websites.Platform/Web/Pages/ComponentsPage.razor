                        Written entirely in C#, Bit’s Blazor UI components are native and therefore have high performance. These components can be used in all Blazor modes (WASM, Server, Hybrid, pre-rendering) while the compressed size of your project will eventually increase up to 180kb!

                        Since Bit components are developed by a professional dedicated team, you can get sufficient technical support from them, and even make open source contributions on GitHub. Bit components have a fast release cycle and are updated at short intervals.
