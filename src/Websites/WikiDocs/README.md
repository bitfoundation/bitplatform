# bitplatform mono repo docs

## Overview
To enhance the understanding of our Open Source Project Repository, all documentation is maintained within a single mono repo. This approach ensures that an AI Wiki can cohesively analyze the entire set of documents, README files, in-code comments, and source code to provide comprehensive insights when queried. All documentation hosted on the following websites originates from this mono repo:

- **bit BlazorUI Components**: Documentation for working with components, including numerous examples, is available at [blazorui.bitplatform.dev](https://blazorui.bitplatform.dev/getting-started).
- **bit Boilerplate Project Template**: Documentation is hosted at [bitplatform.dev/templates](https://bitplatform.dev/templates).
- **Butil (Blazor Utilities for Browser APIs)**: Documentation is available at [bitplatform.dev/butil](https://bitplatform.dev/butil).
- **Bswup (Blazor PWA)**: Documentation is located at [bitplatform.dev/bswup](https://bitplatform.dev/bswup).
- **Besql (Entity Framework Core + SQLite in Browser)**: Documentation is hosted at [bitplatform.dev/besql](https://bitplatform.dev/besql).

## Additional Content
