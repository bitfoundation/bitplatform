# bitplatform mono repo docs

## Overview
To enhance the understanding of our Open Source Project Repository for wikis like [wiki.bitplatform.dev](https://wiki.bitplatform.dev), we maintain all documentation within a single mono repo. This approach ensures that an AI Wiki can analyze the entire set of documents, README files, in-code comments, and source code cohesively to provide comprehensive insights when queried.

## Documentation Sources
All documentation hosted on the following websites originates from this mono repo:

- **bit BlazorUI Components**: Documentation for working with components, including numerous examples, is available at [blazorui.bitplatform.dev](https://blazorui.bitplatform.dev/getting-started).
- **bit Boilerplate Project Template**: Documentation is hosted at [bitplatform.dev/templates](https://bitplatform.dev/templates).
- **Butil (Blazor Utilities for Browser APIs)**: Documentation is available at [bitplatform.dev/butil](https://bitplatform.dev/butil).
- **Bswup (Blazor PWA)**: Documentation is located at [bitplatform.dev/bswup](https://bitplatform.dev/bswup).
- **Besql (Entity Framework Core + SQLite in Browser)**: Documentation is hosted at [bitplatform.dev/besql](https://bitplatform.dev/besql).

## Additional Content
To further enrich the repository, we include valuable content that has not yet been officially published on our websites. These materials are stored in this repository to ensure that an AI Wiki considers them when answering queries, providing a more complete understanding of the project.
