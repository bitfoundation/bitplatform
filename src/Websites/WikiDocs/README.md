# bitplatform mono repo docs

## Overview
To enhance the understanding of our Open Source Project Repository for wikis like [wiki.bitplatform.dev](https://wiki.bitplatform.dev), we maintain all documentation within a single mono repo. This approach ensures that an AI Wiki can analyze the entire set of documents, README files, in-code comments, and source code cohesively to provide comprehensive insights when queried.

## Documentation Sources

- **bit BlazorUI Components**: Documentation for working with components, including numerous examples, is available at [blazorui.bitplatform.dev](https://blazorui.bitplatform.dev/getting-started).
