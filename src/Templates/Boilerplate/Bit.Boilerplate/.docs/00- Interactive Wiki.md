# Interactive Wiki - Read Documentation in Your Native Language

## 🌍 Multilingual/Interactive/Live Documentation with Claude Sonnet 4.5

If you have access to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (or newer), you can read all the documentation in this project in **your native language** - whether it's French, Persian (فارسی), Spanish (Español), German (Deutsch), Chinese (中文), or any other language!

**Additional Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Always Up-to-Date**: The documentation is generated from the **latest source code**, ensuring you always learn from the current project structure
- ✅ **Adapts to your changes**: If you modify the code structure based on your needs, this approach still works for new developers joining your team

- How Does It Work?
- Watch this **[short video tutorial](https://bitplatform.dev/templates/wiki)** to see how it works:

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ **Requires Claude Sonnet 4.5 Access**: You need access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 through GitHub Copilot
- ⚠️ **Takes Time**: Each section takes a moment to generate (usually 30-60 seconds depending on length)

**That's Why We've Pre-Generated English Versions:**

Because of these trade-offs, we've **saved pre-generated English versions** of all documentation sections in the `.docs/` folder. This gives you:
- ⚡ **Instant Access**: No waiting time - just open and read
- 📖 **Offline Reading**: Works without internet or AI model access
- 🔖 **Easy Reference**: Quickly jump between topics

> **📝 Important Note**: If you're reading the **pre-generated saved versions**, we **strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code** instead of Visual Studio, as VS Code provides a **significantly better Markdown Preview experience** with proper formatting, syntax highlighting, and readability.
