/// The Client.Core codebase is designed to support various Blazor hosting models, including Hybrid and WebAssembly, 
/// which may or may not enable pre-rendering. To ensure consistent behavior across all scenarios, 
/// the `IPrerenderStateService` interface is introduced. This service provides the `GetValue` method for data retrieval, 
/// such as during the `OnInitAsync` method in components like UserMenu.
///
/// The `WebPrerenderStateService` implementation of `IPrerenderStateService` facilitates pre-rendering by using 
/// PersistentComponentState to persist data across renders, simplifies the process of managing application state in pre-rendering scenarios outlined in 
/// the documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/prerendering-and-integration#persist-prerendered-state.
/// 
/// For cases where pre-rendering is unnecessary, such as in Blazor Hybrid, a `NoopPrerenderStateService` is provided. This implementation simply executes the provided 
/// function and returns its result without persisting any state.
///
/// If pre-rendering is not required for your project, this service and its related dependencies can be safely removed.
